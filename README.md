# Skyrim Adventure Game Reference Guide

This is an unofficial reference material for "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim: The Adventure Game" which was on Gamefound [here](https://gamefound.com/projects/modiphius/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-the-board-game).

This repository compiles a reference document based on the original rulebook and answers from BoardGameGeek, especially the "Designers' thread" [here](https://BoardGameGeek.com/thread/2992429/skyrim-adventure-game-designers-thread/page/1).
The style of the document is taken from the great Reference guides normally used by Fantasy Flight Games.

You can find the following in this repository:

* The reference guide [here](reference-guide.md)
* A list of issues on the printed cards along with corrections [here](card-fixes.md)

I deliberately did not add all rules from the core rulebook in order to keep the overall effort small.
However if anyone else is willing to contribute such section i will happily accept them.
